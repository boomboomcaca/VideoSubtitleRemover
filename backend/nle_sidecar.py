"""NLE round-trip sidecar export.

RM-76: when a user processes a file inside a DaVinci Resolve / Premiere
edit, they typically want the cleaned video to slot back in at the same
timecode as the original. We don't pretend to re-author the NLE
project; we emit a minimal sidecar that names the source, the cleaned
output, and the time range that was actually processed. The NLE
operator drops the sidecar into their bin or hand-substitutes the clip
using the timecode metadata.

Two formats are supported:
- A CMX 3600 EDL with one event spanning the processed range.
- An FCPXML 1.10 minimal stub naming the cleaned file as an asset.

Both are ASCII-only and small (<2 KB for a 1-event sidecar). Neither
attempts to round-trip transitions or audio tracks; this is the
"hand it to the editor" interchange, not a full project re-author.
