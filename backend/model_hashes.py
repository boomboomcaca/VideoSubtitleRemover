"""Vendored SHA-256 hashes for model weights downloaded by opt-in features.

RM-49: when a feature fetches model weights from the internet on first
use, we verify the downloaded file's hash against a known-good value
shipped with the source tree. Catches:

- Silent supply-chain substitution at the upstream CDN.
- Half-downloaded weight files (truncated tensors crash hours into a
  long render).
- Local on-disk corruption that would otherwise present as nondescript
  runtime errors deep inside the model loader.

`verify_weight_file()` reads in 1 MiB chunks so a multi-GB file does
not need to fit in RAM. Returns True on match; False AND logs a
warning on mismatch. Callers should treat a False return as "fall back
to the cv2 inpainter" rather than crash hard, because hash mismatches
often arise from PyTorch hub cache corruption that resolves on a
manual re-download.

Add a new entry to KNOWN_WEIGHT_HASHES when wiring a new opt-in
inpainter / detector that pulls weights at runtime.
